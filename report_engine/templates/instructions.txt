Purpose of Valuation: {{valuation_purpose}}

Subject Property: {{property_address_full}}

Azimuth confirms that no internal or physical inspection of the subject property has been undertaken.
This valuation has been prepared using Azimuth’s proprietary analytical models, supported by third-party data sources, publicly available records, and information provided by or on behalf of the Client.

The valuation reflects market conditions and information available as at the valuation date and assumes that there have been no material changes to the property since the dates of the underlying data sources used in the analysis.

Should any information relating to floor area, accommodation, condition, tenure, planning status, or legal title prove to be inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated, the valuation outcome may be subject to review.

Scope of Work

This Report constitutes a desktop, model-driven valuation assessment prepared in accordance with the agreed terms of engagement.

No internal inspection, measured survey, structural assessment, or legal due diligence has been carried out.
Accordingly, this Report should not be relied upon as a substitute for a full inspection-based valuation, unless expressly agreed in writing.

Nature of the Valuation

The valuation is derived from a hybrid analytical framework, combining:
- Market evidence
- Statistical and machine-learning models
- Location and property-specific attributes
- Temporal market adjustments

Where applicable, Azimuth provides confidence indicators and limitations to assist users in understanding the reliability of the valuation output.
